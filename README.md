I've built a comprehensive CLI-based trading bot that meets all  assignment requirements. Here's what's been implemented:
✅ Core Features Completed

📈 Market & Limit Orders

    Full market order support (instant buy/sell at current prices)
    Comprehensive limit order functionality with price validation
    Both buy and sell sides supported for all order types

**🔧 Technical Infrastructure

    Binance Testnet integration using the official python-binance library
    Robust input validation for symbols, quantities, and price precision
    Comprehensive logging system (all actions saved to bot.log)
    Professional CLI interface with helpful examples and error messages

    *🗂️ Perfect File Structure (matches the assignment exactly)

🎯 Key Highlights

    Production-ready code with proper error handling and validation
    Testnet-first approach for safe development and testing
    Extensible architecture - advanced order types are structured and ready to implement
